# Bingo Game

The Bingo Game Python script offers an engaging console-based gaming experience where players face off against the computer. Featuring a modular design with abstract data types, the code maintains clarity and organization. Players can initiate new games, load saved sessions, and choose from different difficulty levels. The gameplay involves taking turns selecting numbers, with boards displayed after each move. Save and load functionalities enable players to continue their progress seamlessly. The script incorporates random messages for added dynamism. Developed by Marwan Mostafa, Abdelrahman Ahmed, Abdelrahman Amr, and Karim Wesam for the Introduction to Computing & Programming course in Fall 2023, this open-source project operates under the MIT License.
